This repository contains implementations of essential Machine Learning algorithms using Python. Each notebook demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization to build a solid foundation in ML concepts. Covered algorithms include Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), K-Means Clustering, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gradient Boosting, XGBoost. The goal is to provide clear, beginner-friendly examples that can be extended to real-world projects in analytics, finance, marketing, and beyond.
